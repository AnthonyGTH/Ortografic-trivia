# ionic-trivia
A simple trivia game app built with ionic. This app uses Open Trivia DB. https://opentdb.com/

### Installation ###
1. Clone this repo
2. If you have ionic installed, skip to 3 (Node.js is also required). Otherwise, install it globally.

   `npm install -g cordova ionic`
3. Run `npm install` on the cloned repo.
4. Run `ionic serve`

    That's it! Enjoy :wink:
